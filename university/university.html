        <h2>Democritus University of Thrace</h2>

        <p class="text1"> <br> The Democritus University of Thrace was founded in 1973 and opened its gates for the academic year 1974-1975 with the starting of the Department of Civil Engineering in Xanthi and the Department of Law in Komotini. It was named after the
            ancient Greek philosopher Democritus, who was born in Abdera, Xanthi. The administrative headquarters are based in Komotini, which is also the capital of the administrative region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, while administrative services
            are provided in all four of the city-centers (Xanthi, Komotini, Alexandroupoli, Orestiada).
            <br> The Democritus University of Thrace has been, since its establishment in 1973, the first Greek regional polyhedral university, while its necessity wasn’t exclusively limited to educational purposes.
            <br> Its functioning through its polyhedralism firstly in the cities of Xanthi and Komotini and later at Alexandroupoulis and Orestiada,in addition to its educational and research activities, has been an essential factor in the economic growth
            of the Region of Thrace. Simultaneously, the University contributed in the enhancing of the national and cultural nature of the wider area of Thrace and the upgrade of the biotic and social status with both direct and indirect actions.

        <h2>City of Komotini</h2>
        <br>

        <img class="pic3" src="../pics/subpages/city.jpg" alt="city">
        <p class="text3">
            <br> Komotini is the capital city of Thrace, a region in northeastern Greece. Its name originates by the one given by the Ottomans (Gümülcine) and historians track down its existence back in 5th century BC.
        </p>

        <img class="pic4" src="../pics/subpages/kolona.jpg" alt="kolona">
        <p class="text4">
            <br> It is a multicultural city because of its location and the large number of Muslims who remain there as an exception to the population exchange as described in the Treaty of Lausanne. It is also full of life, since it is home to several
            departments of the Democritus University of Thrace and is packed with its students. Despite the city's cloudy weather that gave her the name 'Little London' by the students, she does not lack the fun. While walking it one finds harmonious
            coexistence of modern and picturesque houses and streets. The most characteristic attraction is the Central Heroon (Spathi), a monument to the fallen of World War II, which adorns the center of the city.

        <h2>Thracing on MIC</h2>

        <p class="text4">
            <br> Thracing on MIC (Model International Crises) is a simulation conference on international organizations and crises which is going to take place in the city of Komotini during the first week of December 2021 and is addressed to students
            who love international law, diplomacy and politics. Participating delegates are invited to play the role of a representative of a state entity in international committees and to manage a simulated crisis of international scope, using the rules
            of international law and their diplomatic skills. More specifically, an international crisis environment will be created, evolving in real time, which will be examined by each of the committees to be simulated (UNGA-Emergency Meeting "United
            for Peace", NATO, Council of Europe ,Council of the European union ,International court of justice, European Court of Justice) to the extent and from the point of view that its jurisdiction allows it. The organization of this academic event
            is an initiative of the newly established association "Visualizing in Thrace:forum of International Law and Politics", based in Komotini. The idea of the conference and the association itself was initiated by some students, who, driven by
            their love for diplomacy and international law, but also for Komotini itself, decided to create a group for fellow students with common interests. The project of Thracing on MIC is part and purpose of the association from the very beginning,
            as is the prominence of Komotini and the Democritus University of Thrace as a fertile ground for academic dialogue and reflection.

        <h2>Visualizing in Thrace</h2>

        <p class="text4">
            <br>Visualizing in Thrace: Forum of Int. Law and Politics is a politically neutral association of students of DUTH (mainly for the faculties of the city of Komotini). Its object is to organize events, seminars and conferences (or webinars)
            on the main topic of international law and international politics (in a broad sense), without being strictly limited to them. That kind of entity did not exist in Komotini so students with such interests had to resort to other associations
            in Athens or Thessaloniki, in order to educate themselves or socialize with people with similar interests. In that sense, promoting the city of Komotini and Democritus University of Thrace, by creating for the first time an environment for
            growth and development in the field of international law is this association's main goal.
