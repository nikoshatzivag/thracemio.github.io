					<em> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Democritus University of Thrace was founded in 1973 and opened its
						gates for the academic year 1974-1975 with the starting of the Department of Civil Engineering
						in Xanthi and the Department of Law in Komotini. It was named after the ancient Greek
						philosopher Democritus, who was born in Abdera, Xanthi. The administrative headquarters are
						based in Komotini, which is also the capital of the administrative region of Eastern Macedonia
						and Thrace, while administrative services are provided in all four of the city-centers (Xanthi,
						Komotini, Alexandroupoli, Orestiada). <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Democritus University of
						Thrace has been, since its establishment in 1973, the first Greek regional polyhedral
						university, while its necessity wasn’t exclusively limited to educational purposes.

			<em> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Its functioning through its polyhedralism firstly in the cities of Xanthi and
				Komotini and later at Alexandroupoulis and Orestiada, in addition to its educational and research
				activities, has been an essential factor in the economic growth of the Region of Thrace. Simultaneously,
				the University contributed in the enhancing of the national and cultural nature of the wider area of
				Thrace and the upgrade of the biotic and social status with both direct and indirect actions.</em>

			<div class="text6">
				<em>
					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Komotini is the capital city of Thrace, a region in northeastern Greece. Its
					name originates by the one given by the Ottomans (Gümülcine) and historians track down its existence
					back in 5th century BC.

				<em>
					It is a multicultural city because of its location and the large number of Muslims who remain there
					as an exception to the population exchange as described in the Treaty of Lausanne. It is also full
					of life, since it is home to several departments of the Democritus University of Thrace and is
					packed with its students. Despite the city's cloudy weather that gave her the name 'Little London'
					by the students, she does not lack the fun. While walking it one finds harmonious coexistence of
					modern and picturesque houses and streets. The most characteristic attraction is the Central Heroon
					(Spathi), a monument to the fallen of World War II, which adorns the center of the city.
